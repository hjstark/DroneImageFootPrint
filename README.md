# DroneImageFootPrint
This Jupyter Notebook computes in a fairly raw way the image footprints of drone-based images.
When running some parameters are requested at the start like filename and -location of the output-file (Esri-Shapefile with the rectangular image footprints). Other parameters like camera-settings need - currently - to be adjusted directly in the code.

Feedback and improvements are very welcome!!
